Type inference.
A feature of the typescript compiler is that it can infer types (implicitly do type declaration for us).

if we define :
let price = 100; 

Typescript compiler will automatically infer number type for price.

The compiler is also able to infer the result of the calculateTaxTS function because 
it knows that only number parameters will be accepted, that 1.2 is a number value, and 
that the result of the multiplication operator on two number values is a number.

The result from the function is assigned to the taxAmount variable, which the compiler is also able to infer as a number. Finally, the compiler knows the type produced by the division operator on two number values and can infer the type of the halfShare variable, too.

/*
Here the priceTS is infer to number by the compiler. But in the calculateTaxTSFixed, the function returns a string as the toFixed() method convert the number to string. So the taxAmountTS variable get infered as a string. 

Now a division between two types happen in line number 104: 

  What happen if this is in JS?
    -The operation returns a number if the taxAmountTS can be typecoersed to a number else it return NaN.
  But in TS automatic type coersion is restricted so this gives error.
