type assertion
======================
A type assertion tells the TypeScript compiler to treat a value as a specific type, known 
as type narrowing. A type assertion is one of the ways that you can narrow a type from a 
union. A type is asserted using the as keyword

/*
In the listing, the as keyword is used to tell the compiler that the value assigned to the 
taxNumber variable is a number and that the value assigned to the taxString variable 
is a string important: No type conversion is performed by a type assertion, which only tells 
the compiler what type it should apply to a value for type checking.
